Challenge 6 - python_api_challenge

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this challenge we were asked to find over 500 cities using the citypy libarary and Open Weather Map API and find the relationship between different weather variables and the latitude. After analyzing the different scatter plots we find that the temperaure and latitude are the only two that have a correlation to each other. In the northern hemisphere there was a negative correlation and in the southern hemisphere there was a positive correlation. 

Part 2: VacationPy
After finding 500 cities we were asked to map these locations and then had to find cities which we felt were perfect weather conditions. We used Geoapify API to find a hotels in these cities and then map them.
